# Staged patches — built and tested, not yet in `series`

A patch here has passed its CPU tests and waits for its CARD gates before it
joins `series` (CLAUDE.md: a stage ships only after its gate; a rebuilt
backend is a new engine, gated once). `tests/test_localai_patches.py` ignores
this folder: nothing here is applied by `build.sh`, and no release digest
names it. To build a test backend with one: append its path, relative to
`deploy/localai/patches` (`staged/0005-llama-cpp-encoder-decoder-memory.patch`),
to a LOCAL, uncommitted copy of `series`, then `build.sh` as usual. When its
gates pass, `git mv` it up one level, add its line to `series`, and rename its
entry in docs/notes/localai-bugs.md from "P5 (staged)" to "P5".

| patch | what | gates before it moves up |
|---|---|---|
| `0005-llama-cpp-encoder-decoder-memory.patch` | stage 1 of docs/notes/llama-cpp-encoder-decoder.md: the encoder output kept per sequence (`llama_memory_enc_dec`), so a slot is encoded while others decode; on top of P3 and P4 | on the card, the f32-cache MADLAD backend rebuilt with it: T3 (same group twice), in-wave vs alone (bar 90 %), a lone request against P4's bytes, seconds per question; then the retrieval comparison |
